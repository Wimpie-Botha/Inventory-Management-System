# Inventory-Management-System
I helped developed an inventory management system for Woolworths (not affiliated) in second year of University. The program has a simple and easy-to-use UI, easy checkout processes, real-time stock updates, and product baskets all in one. The system has a powerful, intricate relational database. Technologies used are C# and ASP.NET.
